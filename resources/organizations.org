  Not a likely partner due to research focus and grant structure.

GPACS was founded in 1983 by a diverse group of faculty who came
together out of concern about the nuclear weapons stand-off between
the United States and the former Soviet Union. Although the Soviet
Union no longer exists and the Cold War of the 1980s is a thing of the
past, the core of the vision of the founders of GPACS– the imperative
that as citizens and as scholars we pursue the goal of global peace
and ward off the dangers of global conflict—continues to animate our
work today. Throughout our almost 40 years of work, we have fostered
diverse and outstanding contributions from the UCI community as
scholars, students, and citizens, to the promotion of global peace and
to innovative and rigorous analysis of the factors shaping global
conflict. We facilitate research and interdisciplinary on peace and
conflict through informal presentations, Colloquia, public lectures,
conferences, and other activities.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOKA EDUCATION Soka (“to create value”) education
has its origins in the work of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, a Japanese
educator and Buddhist leader. During World War II, Makiguchi was
arrested as a “thought criminal” by Japanese military authorities for
his opposition to the war and for his defense of religious freedom. He
died in prison in 1944. The small education society that Makiguchi
founded in 1930 has since grown to become one of the world’s largest
lay Buddhist organizations.

Soka schools range from kindergartens to the 8,800-student Soka
University in Japan. These schools have established a tradition of
humanistic learning and scholarship where the focus is on each
student’s growth and development.
