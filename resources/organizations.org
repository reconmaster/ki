A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOKA EDUCATION Soka (“to create value”) education
has its origins in the work of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, a Japanese
educator and Buddhist leader. During World War II, Makiguchi was
arrested as a “thought criminal” by Japanese military authorities for
his opposition to the war and for his defense of religious freedom. He
died in prison in 1944. The small education society that Makiguchi
founded in 1930 has since grown to become one of the world’s largest
lay Buddhist organizations.

Soka schools range from kindergartens to the 8,800-student Soka
University in Japan. These schools have established a tradition of
humanistic learning and scholarship where the focus is on each
student’s growth and development.
