Media provides an imaging dimension to snapshot the state of reality
as captured by the content creator. Tracking the content and creator
provides a way to account for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)][bias]] that invevitably affects
everyones world view. Accounting for this bias allows us to build a
reality that is accomodating for all.
