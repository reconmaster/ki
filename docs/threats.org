* Introduction
There are a variety of issues that work against the Objective of World
Peace. This document will serve as an agenda to identify and research
anything that compromises a state of Peace for all of humanity.
* TODO Chemical
** TODO [#A] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid][Opioid]]
Over-perscription of opioids by doctors in the USA led to an epidemic
of opiod abuse that brings a variety of health and societal problems.
While opioids are effective at alleviating acute pain such as trauma,
they may be no more effective than over-the-counter medication for
long-term [[https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/patients/therapy-expectations.html][pain management]].

Furthermore, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs][War on Drugs]] policy has led to people that suffer
from the disease of addiction being treated like criminals rather than
patients in need of medical care. Unfortunately, the same War on Drugs
policy has led to opioids which are one of the cheapest and effective
forms of painkillers for acute pain being unavailbe in countries that
could use these medicines to alleviate the pain associated with
trauma.
*** TODO [#A] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl][Fentanyl]]
A highly potent synthetic analgesic that is 50 to 100 times more
potent than heroid and recent appearance of this chemical in street
drugs has led to a surge in overdose deaths.
